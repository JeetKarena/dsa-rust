// Welcome to the DSA in Rust library! This library is designed to provide high-performance
// implementations of classic data structures and algorithms, optimized for speed and memory efficiency.
// The modules included in this library are organized to facilitate easy navigation and usage.

// The `algorithms` module contains various sorting and searching algorithms, implemented in a way
// that leverages Rust's powerful features to ensure both safety and performance. Whether you're looking
// for a quick sort or a binary search, you'll find efficient implementations here.

// The `data_structures` module provides custom implementations of fundamental data structures such as
// linked lists and binary trees. These implementations are designed to be both easy to use and highly
// performant, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.

// The `utils` module includes a collection of utility functions that support the main algorithms and
// data structures. These helper functions handle common tasks such as generating sorted integers,
// writing data to files, and shuffling collections, allowing you to focus on the core logic of your
// algorithms and data structures.
